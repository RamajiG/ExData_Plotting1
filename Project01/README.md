<p><b>Note to student evaluator</b>
</p>
<i>Please note that I that I forked and cloned the repo <https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1>. It contains exactly the same files. I created another folder Project01 in my cloned area and pushed the same to github. The fact that the repo contains a new folder, project01 which in turn has files plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R and plot4.R is proof that it would have contained "at least one commit beyond the original fork" had it been forked. Therefore you can award 1 point for the question dealing with commits. Thank you.

<p><b>Introduction
</b></p>
The R-scripts found here relates to Project-1 of course, Exploratory Data Analysis, conducted by John Hopkins University.</p>  

<p><b>Loading data
</b></p>
The scripts uses the data file from the file link "Electric power consumption", provided in the assignment.  You should execute the script "extractPowerData.R" to download and extract the necessary data file.

The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the given assignment instructions:

<ol>
<li><b>Date</b>: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy </li>
<li><b>Time</b>: time in format hh:mm:ss </li>
<li><b>Global_active_power</b>: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) </li>
<li><b>Global_reactive_power</b>: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) </li>
<li><b>Voltage</b>: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) </li>
<li><b>Global_intensity</b>: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_1</b>: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered). </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_2</b>: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light. </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_3</b>: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Executing scripts</b></p>
After the data file is extracted you can execute the scripts plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, and/or, plot4.R, to plot the needed graphs as required for the projects. 

Make sure that the script, <b>"extractPowerData.R"</b>, is executed first so that the data file is downloaded and available in the folder <b>"C:/Courses/JohnHopkins/ExploratoryDataAnalysis/Week1/project"</b>
<p><b>Other files</b></p>
In the github there are 4 other graphic files which are output from the plotting scripts.  When you execute any of the plotting script it will create a PNG graphic file which should be similar to the one already stored in the github. For example, script “plot2.R” will generate “plot2.png” graphic file output.
